    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Breasts - 1 poach boneless skinless chicken breasts, but you could also use
                leftover rotisserie chicken.
            </li>
            <li>Mayonnaise - The best creamy binder to mix all the inggredients together. And it's easy to make mayonnaise at home!</li>
            <li>Dijon Mustard - Just a little Dijon mustard adds great depth of flavor and a little spice.</li>
            <li>Red Grapes - You could use red or green seedless grapes</li>
            <li>Celery - Crisp celery crunch</li>
            <li>Green Onion - Adds savory flavor without being too pungent, which is perfect.</li>
            <li>Toasted Almonds - Toast your sliced almonds to bring out that nutty flavor.</li>
            <li>Parsley - One of the best herbs for adding to salads, just chop up a few tablespoons.</li>
            <li>Tarragon - The best secret ingredient! You'll be amazed at how much flavor just a little bit of tarragon adds to the salad.</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice - For that bright freshness.</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper - Always season to your personal preference.</li>
    
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p><h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3></p>
    <p>There is really only three steps:</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Toast</strong>: Lightly toast 1/2 cup of almonds in a pan on the stove. Let them cool completely to room temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Slice and Dice</strong>: First, dice up your chicken breasts into small 1/2-inch pieces. Then quarter the grapes, dice the celery, parsley and tarragon, and slice the green onion.</li>       
            <li><strong>Mix</strong>: Add all the ingredients to a large bowl and mix everything together until it's well combined. Season with a bit of salt and pepper - and you're done!</li>
